# AccomplishmentTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.8.
It has been archived due to an outdated use of AngularJS and the fact that it was only meant as a small test project.

## Usage
This program is being used to track accomplishments, praise, finished tasks and issues I faced throughout my week at work.

## Benefit
By tracking a list of relevant information about my work performance I am able to use it as a means to communicate clearer with my manager to improve the quality and quantity of my output.
